About

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US allows foreign workers to work in the United States temporarily or permanently. It also ensures that US workers are not adversely affected in the workplace and that specific requirements are met when hiring foreign workers to address workforce shortages. The immigration programs are managed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).

1) Problem Statement:

# OFLC processes job certification applications from employers who intend to bring foreign workers to the United States and issues certifications.
# Due to a high volume of applications last year, OFLC requires machine learning models to shortlist visa applicants based on previous data.
# The goal of this project is to build a classification model:
## To predict if a visa application will be approved or denied based on the given dataset.
## To recommend suitable profiles for visa certification or denial based on specific criteria influencing the decision.

2) Data Collection.
# The Dataset is part of Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)
# The data consists of 25480 Rows and 12 Columns
